Example Data Flow:
=================

1. Schedule Trigger activates workflow at defined intervals
2. Read data from various sources (S3, APIs, databases)
3. Process and filter data based on business logic
4. Match/join data from multiple sources
5. Generate content or notifications
6. Send notifications via preferred channels

AWS Services Available:
======================

- AWS EFS: For persistent file storage
- AWS S3: For object storage and data exchange
- AWS SNS: For sending notifications
- AWS Lambda: For serverless functions (via HTTP requests)

Customization:
=============

- Modify trigger schedule as needed
- Add custom data sources and processing logic
- Implement error handling and retry mechanisms
- Configure notification channels based on requirements
